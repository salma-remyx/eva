"""Turn-taking metric using ElevenLabs audio timestamps (no LLM judge).

Per-turn scores are continuous in [0, 1]. For each turn we use the signal that actually
characterizes what happened on that turn:
  - turn ∈ assistant_interrupted_turns → min(overlap_score, count_score, post_interrupt_score)
                                         (bounded by AGENT_INTERRUPT_MAX_SCORE = 0.5 — the
                                         overlap and count sub-scores are each capped at
                                         0.5, so even a clean-looking interrupt lands at ≤ 0.5)
  - turn ∈ user_interrupted_turns      → agent-yield-based score
  - turn ∈ both sets                   → min of the two above
  - otherwise                          → latency-based score

Tool-call-aware latency: turns where the agent issued a tool call (detected from
``context.conversation_trace``) use a more lenient upper end of the latency curve
(sweet-spot extends to 3000ms, hard-late at 5000ms) because tool execution adds inherent
latency. The same flag loosens the ``late_rate`` classification threshold to 4000ms.
Lower-end thresholds (early penalty and sweet-spot ramp-up) are unchanged.

Main turn_taking.score = mean(per-turn scores).

Flat headline sub-metrics (one number each — show up as columns in analysis views):
  Latency:              mean_latency_ms, p50_latency_ms, p90_latency_ms,
                        on_time_rate, early_rate, late_rate
  Agent interruptions:  agent_interruption.rate (always),
                        agent_interruption.num_interruptions (None when rate = 0),
                        agent_interruption.mean_overlap_ms,
                        agent_interruption.mean_overlap_score,
                        agent_interruption.mean_count_score,
                        agent_interruption.mean_post_interrupt_latency_ms,
                        agent_interruption.mean_post_interrupt_latency_score
                        (all except rate and num_interruptions only when rate > 0;
                        the post_interrupt_* pair is additionally gated on at least
                        one interrupt turn having a settled agent response afterward)
  User interruptions:   user_interruption.rate (always),
                        user_interruption.mean_yield_ms,
                        user_interruption.mean_yield_score
                        (the latter two only when rate > 0)

All reported sub-metrics are consistent with the main score: ``mean_overlap_score``,
``mean_count_score``, and ``mean_yield_score`` aggregate exactly the per-turn scores
that feed into ``turn_taking.score``.
