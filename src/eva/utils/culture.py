"""Culture/language placeholder resolution for evaluation records.

Datasets and scenario databases store person identity as placeholder tokens. The
actual per-language values live on the record under ``culture_overrides`` and
``romanized_culture_overrides``. Resolution happens just-in-time before data is
handed to the simulator, the assistant tool runtime, or metrics.

Placeholders:
- ``<FIRST_NAME>`` / ``<LAST_NAME>``           — substituted from ``culture_overrides[lang]``
                                                  (may contain non-ASCII script).
- ``<FIRST_NAME_ROMANIZED>`` / ``<LAST_NAME_ROMANIZED>``
                                                — substituted from
                                                  ``romanized_culture_overrides[lang]``
                                                  (ASCII; used for email local-parts etc).

Translated opening utterances live at ``user_goal.<language>_starting_utterance``.
